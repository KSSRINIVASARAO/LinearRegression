Linear Regression :
Linear Regressoin is the most basic and popular algorithm of machine learning. It is supervised machine learning algorithm which is predicted output is real values/continuous. Or, Relationship between input/independent variables and single output/dependent variable. We will get linear regression image look like : -

Objective :
To make a simple linear regression model operating on one variable from scratch using statistical formulas

Simple Linear Regression
A linear line relationship between one input/independent variable(X) and one output/dependent variable(y).

 y = mX + b
Where, y is dependent/target variable; X is input/independent variable; m is slop of regression line; b is y-intercept.

Approach :
The model is built in the following steps

Data Wrangling

Data Cleaning : Missing Values

Visualisation : UniVariate

- Histograms
- Scatter Plot 
- Boxplot
Parameter Functions :

- Mean and Variance
- Co-Variance
- Coefficients
- Splitting Test Data
